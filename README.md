üìä Results & Insights
Video games are a million dollar international business.  New games were released every year from 1980 to 2016 when data was collected.  Business in general seem to be on the decline.  Each company/ platform tends to cycle out after 3.7 years.  The most popular systems at the time of data collection were the PS3 and PS4.  

In general critics tended to assign games higher ratings than users would  Perhaps partially to help increase sales (which positive views achieved).  Another reason for higher critic reviews would be that the critics have more insight into modifications and improvements made since reviewing a wide variety of games.  Critics also receive games for free to review.  However there were several games that users rated as being below a 20 (in a rating scale up to 100).  

Games are not created to be played equally across all platforms.  Some are optimized for the user experience in one platform. The game ‚ÄúCall of Duty: Black Ops‚Äù sold highest on the PS3 and X360.  

Users preferred action video games over any other type of video game.  However different regions had their own trends.  The smallest market examined (Japan) preferred role-playing games over any other genre.  These results were achieved independent of ESRB ratings (which were not available for every game). 

In choosing to design and market a successful game for 2017 this data helps draw some conclusion. To achieve highest financial gain the video game should be action or sports based.  Marketing would be more successful in the North American regions.  Sales in North American as significantly higher than in other regions.  Unknown if this is because of access to platforms, electricity, and disposable income or another reason.  Critics should be sent a free marketing example of the game to evaluate.  If a high rating is achieved this should be mentioned in all marketing material.  Happy creating.
