#üéÆ Predicting Video Game Success: Trends, Sales & Strategy with Python

In the high-stakes world of video game publishing, one question can make or break a launch: Will this game sell? Imagine being able to forecast that answer‚Äîbefore development is even complete. This project was born from that ambition.

As video games exploded across generations and continents, so did the data. Leveraging a public dataset of game sales, platform trends, and review scores through 2016, this project tells a story of rise and fall‚Äîof consoles, genres, and user preferences. But more than just a retrospective, it builds the foundation for data-driven forecasting of what might succeed in 2017.

From data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to regional segmentation and hypothesis testing, this end-to-end machine learning-ready notebook offers a real-world case study in predictive analytics, customer profiling, and insight generation for business strategy. All work was done in Python using Jupyter Notebook, with an eye toward scalability, reproducibility, and real-world impact.

## üîß Techniques Demonstrating Industry-Ready Skills

| **Category**             | **Techniques Applied** |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Data Engineering**     | Renamed columns to lowercase, converted data types, handled missing values contextually, filtered for analysis-ready datasets |
| **Exploratory Data Analysis** | Created boxplots, scatterplots, and bar charts; analyzed sales distributions, genre and platform trends |
| **User Profiling**       | Built regional profiles (NA, EU, JP) with top 5 platforms and genres; analyzed variation in regional preferences |
| **Business Analytics**   | Measured platform lifespan; evaluated genre profitability; compared cross-platform game performance |
| **Hypothesis Testing**   | Formulated and tested hypotheses using t-tests; compared user ratings across platforms and genres; used Œ± = 0.05 |
| **Data Cleaning**        | Replaced placeholder values like `TBD`; converted scores from object to numeric with coercion |
| **Data-Driven Strategy** | Recommended genre/platform focus for 2017 based on trends; linked review scores to marketing potential |
| **Communication & Insight** | Delivered clear, actionable recommendations based on analysis; connected results to business goals |

üéØ Conclusion: Designing the Next Hit Game‚ÄîWith Data
The video game industry isn‚Äôt just driven by creativity‚Äîit‚Äôs steered by data, timing, and understanding what players crave. Through this project, we didn‚Äôt just look at charts and numbers. We uncovered the life cycles of consoles, the rise and fall of genres, and how global regions play differently. We watched how critics shaped sales and how platform loyalty influenced profitability.

The insights speak clearly:

Action and sports games are the titans of financial success.

North America dominates the market‚Äîbut Japan‚Äôs preference for role-playing games is a cultural outlier that can‚Äôt be ignored.

Critics matter. A positive review can increase sales by fivefold.

Some platforms are aging out‚Äîand the data shows exactly when they peaked and when they began to fade.

By treating the dataset like a product pipeline, this project simulated the real-world challenge of helping a business decide: What game should we make next, and who should we make it for?

If this were 2017, recommendation is building an action-based game, optimized for PS4, and marketing it heavily in North America, with free early access to critics. That‚Äôs not guesswork. That‚Äôs data science in action.

This project demonstrates more than technical fluency. It shows how machine learning engineers can translate raw data into strategic decisions‚Äîand help shape the future of an entire industry.
